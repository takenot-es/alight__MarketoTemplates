  session_title: Name That Law&colon; What to Do When a Leave Is Covered By More Than One Law
  session_description: <p>What do you do when an employee is on a single leave of absence that is covered by more than one law? Your challenge is to determine which aspect of each law takes precedence over the others. A single absence could be a qualified event under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, workers’ compensation, state paid or unpaid family and medical leave laws, and/or a disability program. Add the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act into the mix, and you have a minefield of rules and regulations that may be tricky to traverse. During this interactive hour, Alight’s compliance experts will walk you through real-life complex scenarios that we see every day — leaving you better educated about the knowledge and resources you need when you come across these challenging situations.</p>
